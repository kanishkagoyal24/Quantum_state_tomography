# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed primarily by me.  
AI-based tools were used in a limited and responsible manner to support development and documentation.

## Tools Used

- **ChatGPT**
  - Used for:
    - Clarifying conceptual understanding of quantum state tomography
    - Debugging isolated implementation errors in PyTorch
    - Improving clarity and structure of documentation (README and docs)

No AI tool was used to directly generate final experimental results or to bypass understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Nature of Assistance

AI assistance was limited to:
- Suggesting code corrections during debugging
- Explaining mathematical operations (e.g., matrix decompositions)
- Refining documentation language for readability

All model architecture choices, training logic, evaluation metrics, and experimental decisions were made and validated by me.

---

## Verification of AI-Assisted Components

- All AI-suggested code was manually reviewed and tested in Google Colab
- Numerical outputs (fidelity, trace distance, latency) were independently computed and verified
- Physical constraints (Hermitian, PSD, unit trace) were explicitly enforced and checked

Only verified and understood components were retained in the final submission.

## Statement of Responsibility

I take full responsibility for the correctness, originality, and integrity of this work.
